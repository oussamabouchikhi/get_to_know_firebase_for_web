# Firebase Meetup
Get to Know Firebase for web Google codelab, in which I learned some of the basics of Firebase to create interactive web applications. I have build and deployed an event RSVP and guestbook chat app using several Firebase products.

### How to use
1) Create a project in the Firebase console
2) Enable
* Firestore (with rules in test mode) - https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/database
* Email / Password Auth -  https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/authentication/providers
3) Add a web app, and add the config snippet to index.js after `// Add Firebase config here`- https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/general/web
